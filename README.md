- Did you you have bad day?

- Are you tired of fixing nasty bugs?

- Do you ask yourself 'to denormalize or not to denormalize the database'?

**Shoot all your problems away!**

Destroy the web-site with a bunch of weapons from the Star Wars movie!

(Don't worry, it won't cause any permanent damage to the project. At least we hope so.)

###[DEMO](http://jssolutionsdev.com)

Destroy any web-site by executing this command in the DT console:
```
var script=document.createElement("script");script.type="text/javascript";script.src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/jssolutionsdev/star-wars/r.min.js";document.body.appendChild(script);
```
You can find sources that can be executed manually in execute.js/execute.min.js.
